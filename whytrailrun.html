       <h1>Trail Running</h1>
     <p>Running is the most primal of sports. Just you, your legs, and the distance they can cover.

      For many, it’s that simplicity that draws them in.
      
      When we strip away the smooth roadways, bike paths, and wide sidewalks, we’re left with something even more fundamental, simple, grounding: trail running.</p>
      
      <p>Trail running brings us back to the most basic of pleasures — moving quickly through the woods, over roots, rocks, and downed trees. It’s the adrenaline we once got from being chased, or from being on the other side and doing the hunting. And it’s the pleasure we found as children playing in the trees and splashing through mud puddles.
      
      We run roads because they are convenient and offer an easy surface for a good workout. Trail running can be about ease and exercise as well, but it can also offer a path back to nature not found on a city street.</p>
      
      As John Muir once said, “The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.”
      
      And as more runners find the appeal in getting off the road and away from traffic, the sport has been growing in popularity. Trail races from 5ks to marathons are popping up in all sorts of communities. More and more people are pushing themselves in new ways by training for trail ultramarathons, and embracing the natural challenges we find in the wild.
      
      There are countless reasons to try out trail running, and whether it’s for the thrill of the challenge, to fight against the growing nature deprivation disorder, or just for the joy of the workout that gets you motivated enough to try out trail running, it’ll be worth it.
      
      Unfortunately, trails intimidate a lot of runners who are accustomed to the road. Here’s everything you’ll need to know before hitting the dirt.</p>
